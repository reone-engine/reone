reone is a free and open source game engine, capable of running Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and its sequel, The Sith Lords. We aim to provide an engine that is flexible and modern, and can be used to:

* Play KotOR and TSL from beginning to end
* Create mods that drastically change the gameplay or improve the visuals

Currently, the most fundamental engine subsystems are already implemented. Actual gameplay, however, is very limited. See project [gallery](https://github.com/seedhartha/reone/wiki/Gallery) and [roadmap](https://github.com/seedhartha/reone/wiki/Roadmap) in the Wiki.

## Installation

Those wishing to test reone, can either download a prebuilt executable from the [releases](https://github.com/seedhartha/reone/releases) page, or build it from source. Building it requires a modern C++ compiler and a set of free and open source libraries. See detailed instructions for your operating system [here](https://github.com/seedhartha/reone/wiki/Installation).

To run a game using reone, you must legally own it – we do not endorse piracy. Nowadays both games can be downloaded from Steam or GOG.com. Keep in mind that reone is tested against vanilla versions of the games – mod support is not guaranteed.

Install [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) to run prebuilt Windows executables.

## Usage

Specify a game path to run the game, e.g. `reone --game C:\swkotor`

Controls:
* Use WASD and ZC keys to move around
* Left click to interact with an object
* Use V key to switch the camera type
* Use "-" and "+" keys to adjust the game speed

## Configuration

reone can be configured from either a command line or a configuration file. Configuration file, named "reone.cfg", must be located in the current directory. See a complete list of options [here](https://github.com/seedhartha/reone/wiki/Program-options).

## Contribution

reone is open to potential contributors. Contact me at <vkremianskii@gmail.com> if you're interested in taking a particular task from the [roadmap](https://github.com/seedhartha/reone/wiki/Roadmap).

## Similar Projects

reone is not the only project aiming to reimplement the Odyssey engine – there are at least four alternatives:

* [xoreos](https://github.com/xoreos/xoreos) – a more ambitious and a more established project, which I had contributed to and use alot as a reference.
* [KotOR.js](https://github.com/KobaltBlu/KotOR.js) – a fascinating JavaScript-based remake.
* [KotOR-Unity](https://github.com/rwc4301/KotOR-Unity) – a Unity-based reimplementation.
* The Northern Lights by [Lachlan O'Neill](https://github.com/lachjames) – another Unity-based reimplementation and a level editor.

In contrast, this is what reone offers:

* Written in C++ – industry standard, statically typed language; faster than the JavaScript implementation.
* Custom game engine based on SDL 2 and OpenGL 3.3 – no Unity knowledge required.
* KotOR and TSL only, unlike xoreos, which aims to reimplement all of Aurora Engine games – faster development.
